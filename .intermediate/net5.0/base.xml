            The PlayerController takes player input and moves the player. This needs
            to match between client and server. The client moves the local player and
            then checks that when the server moves the player, everything is the same.
            This is called prediction. If it doesn't match the player resets everything
            to what the server did, that's a prediction error.
            You should really never manually set this on the client - it's replicated so
            that setting the class on the server will automatically network and set it 
            on the client.

            A prop that physically simulates as a single rigid body. It can be constrained to other physics objects using hinges 
            or other constraints. It can also be configured to break when it takes enough damage.
            Note that the health of the object will be overridden by the health inside the model, to ensure consistent health game-wide.
            If the model used by the prop is configured to be used as a prop_dynamic (i.e. it should not be physically simulated) then it CANNOT be
            used as a prop_physics. Upon level load it will display a warning in the console and remove itself. Use a prop_dynamic instead.
